# EnergyGrid_AOSE

This project simulates a grid environment where energy consumers and producers are seeking for energy transaction. 

* Consumers need energy, and producers produce it. 
* There is also a marketplace where producers advertise their energy services with a price table for the next 24 hours. 
* Typical properties of producers are the selling price and the type of energy (renewable or not). 
* Typically producers of renewable energy sell at higher prices than the others. 
* Consumers gain utility based on the type of energy, on its price, or both (assume a simple utility function for comparing offers). 
* A consumer can see the prices and type of energy at the marketplace but then must do the transaction with the producer (book her consumption and pay). 
* It is rare, but a producer may be fully booked for a specific time, and the consumer must change the selected producer or consumption time. Develop a MAS to tackle this problem.
